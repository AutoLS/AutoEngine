# AutoEngine
My personal game engine. 

Since it's my first engine it's pretty messy so I'm planning to rewrite the engine soon and going to build as a dll. 

This engine uses SDL2.0, glad, and stb libraries.

You can get them here: 

SDL: https://www.libsdl.org/

STB: https://github.com/nothings/stb

GLAD: https://glad.dav1d.de/
